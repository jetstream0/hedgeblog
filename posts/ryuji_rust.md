A month or two ago, I "translated" [Ryuji](/posts/ryuji-docs), originally written in Typescript, into Rust.

I mostly wrote this to practice writing Rust, which I guess is a success. In this project, I've somehow once again avoided properly figuring out how to use lifetimes (hey, I tried). That's a victory for my brain but probably a failure for my Rust skills.

The source code is on [Github](https://github.com/jetstream0/ryuji-rust) and the auto-generated documentation is on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ryuji-rust/latest/ryuji_rust/). If, for whatever reason, you actually want to use Ryuji-Rust, it might be helpful to look at the [tests](https://github.com/jetstream0/ryuji-rust/blob/master/src/lib.rs), [example](https://github.com/jetstream0/ryuji-rust/tree/master/example), and the [Ryuji docs](/posts/ryuji-docs) page.
