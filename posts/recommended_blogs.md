A very short (so far) list of blogs I read when HN's been reloaded for the tenth time and the front page hasn't changed:

- [A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog): classical and medieval history
- [Vitalik Buterin's website ](https://vitalik.eth.limo): ethereum
- [BIG by Matt Stoller](https://www.thebignewsletter.com): monopolies
- [Matt Lakeman](https://mattlakeman.org): mostly travel
- [Computers Are Bad](https://computer.rip/archive.html): tech
