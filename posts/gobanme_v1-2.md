![an example of the extension](/images/gobanme_example.png)

GoBanMe is a pretty neat browser extension that was made to **tip your favorite websites Banano**. It also functions as a rudimentary wallet.

Essentially, you can microtip your favorite Banano related websites like JungleTV, Yellowspyglass, or various faucets. The funds will go to the creator's wallet. There's even a 'Discover' Tab where you can find a list of websites that support GoBanMe.

It's been around for a while, but recently it was (finally) updated.

For firefox, this update makes GoBanMe more like a wallet, letting you send banano to any address, not just website operators. There will be many more updates to come, with the intent of GoBanMe becoming a "Metamask" of sorts for Banano. Additionally, **youtube channels with a banano address in their description can now be tipped!**

For chrome, there are now huge usability improvements!

Download it here for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gobanme/) (recommended).
