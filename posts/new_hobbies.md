So, it's been roughly 5 months since I've written anything on here. Unfortunately, I am still alive, meaning I am obliged to write a post in order to justify paying for this domain name.

Recently, I've gotten into two new hobbies as programming-wise things are a little boring. I'm only occasionally working on two projects, one of which is a job from a client. The other is an offline wiki* cli reader (currently only tested wikiquote but it probably works with wikipedia and whatnot) written in Lisp Scheme.

## Toki Pona

Learning Toki Pona has been on my list of things to do for a while now, so I decided to at least start learning the basics. If you aren't familiar with Toki Pona, it is a conlang (constructed language; think Esperanto or Klingon), with only around 120 words and a little more than a dozen sounds.

To help memorize the vocab and practice grammar, I made [toki-pona.pages.dev](https://toki-pona.pages.dev) (please don't look at the source code, it's an absolute mess). That site takes all of its content from [mun.la/sona](https://mun.la/sona) which is a fantastic resource for learning the basics of Toki Pona. I can't speak to the more advanced sections, because I haven't gotten there, and because some are incomplete. Iirc the associated youtube channel has a lot more content.

In the last week I haven't practiced. Hopefully I'll get back to this soon. It would be nice to find someone who actually speaks / writes in the language, for some motivation and practice.

## Scanlation

Another big thing that has been on my todo list for a long time is scanlating manga. Scanlations are fan translations of manga. One of the manga I was reading on mangadex was dropped with only one volume left. The original scanlation group stopped because an official english translation was available. I really wanted to read the rest, so I decided to take matters in my own hands and start translating it. After the first two or three chapters translated, two others joined my group and helped with translation and upscaling, which I'm incredibly grateful for.

It should be fairly trivial to find my group and what titles we've scanlated, but I will avoid doing so here because, well, scanlating is not exactly legal. Rather, it is illegal and a violation of copyright law (hurray).

That's all.
